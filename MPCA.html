            <strong>Why we have enlisted KYC.</strong></br></br>

            KYC Stands for “Know Your Customer”. Know your customer (KYC) policy is an important step developed globally to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing etc.

            At MyPayingAds, we take the protection of our members and our brand very seriously. Over the past 18month our standing as a world leading advertising platform is being solidified. Being in this fantastic position comes with more responsibility.

            We operate the worlds premium advertise and get rewarded platform in MyPayingAds.com. This platform is fully compliant with KYC regulations. If any auditor/governing body was to question payments being made, then we could simply liaise with our account managers from Payza or Solid Trust pay. As you are aware to have an account with these payment processors they would have conducted KYC (you need to send them documents to prove your identity).

            Now when considering MyPayingCryptoAds, we are fully aware that many BTC wallet providers allow people to open an account without KYC. This could mean we would potentially be rewarding individuals that are not eligible to be rewarded under their country's law and regulations.

            We will not risk breaking rules and regulations and this is the key driver behind the implementation of KYC in MyPayingCryptoAds.com
            </br>
            I hope this help explains our rational for KYC.</br>
